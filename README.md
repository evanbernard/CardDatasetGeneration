# Introduction

The goal of this project is to generate a data set of random cards rotated and placed in a random way on a random background, while keeping track of the labels on the cards. Running SceneGeneration.py will produce as many images as you specify, where each image contains the number of cards you specify, and it will also generate a .txt file that lists all the image names and labels and coordinates in each image.
